# Spec for mongodb-log parser

## Elements to extract from log files

### General

All log lines have these general values.

#### Timestamps

There are 4 datetime formats that need to be supported. 

- ctime-pre2.4    `Wed Dec 31 19:00:00`
- ctime           `Wed Dec 31 19:00:00.000`
- iso8601-utc     `1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`
- iso8601-local   `1969-12-31T19:00:00.000+0500`

They are at the beginning of a log line. The regex pattern names to be extracted are:

- `timestamp`
- `timestamp_format`


#### Threads / Connections

The `thread` is listed in square brackets after the timestamp. The example below shows two lines with threads `conn611` and `initandlisten`.

```
2014-05-16T10:39:00.938-0400 [conn611] end connection 127.0.0.1:57499 (22 connections now open)
2014-05-16T10:50:13.450-0400 [initandlisten] recover : no journal files present, no recovery needed
```

The regex pattern name is `thread`.

Each connection is its own thread, for example `conn611` above. While everything happening on that connection (including its end, see example above) has the correct thread name, the opening of the connection is handled by the `initandlisten` thread (in mongod) and the `mongosMain` thread (in mongos). It's often interesting to know when a certain connection was opened. Therefore, a second regex pattern named `conn` is exposed, that returns the connection name even for the "connection accepted" log line. The connection name can be extracted from the `#<number>` value after the IP address and port.

Example:

```
2014-05-31T14:21:14.734-0400 [initandlisten] connection accepted from 127.0.0.1:51786 #14 (3 connections now open)
2014-05-31T14:21:14.734-0400 [conn14] command admin.$cmd command: isMaster { ismaster: 1 } keyUpdates:0 numYields:0  reslen:371 0ms
2014-05-31T14:21:14.735-0400 [conn14] end connection 127.0.0.1:51786 (2 connections now open)
```

| line # | `thread`      | `conn` |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| 1      | initandlisten | conn14 |
| 2      | conn14        | conn14 |
| 3      | conn14        | conn14 |


### Operations

Some log lines are "operations" (query, getmore, update, delete, command). These do not match up with the `OP_*` opcodes of the wire protocol (e.g. commands are queries on a special `.$cmd` collection), but should be seen as "logical" operations. Operations have a type (query, getmore, update, delete, command), a namespace on which the operation is executed (consisting of database.collection) and a duration in milliseconds.

The exposed regex pattern names are `operation`, `namespace`, `database`, `collection`, `duration`.

Some other events do not follow the operations pattern but still have a duration that is useful to extract, for example:

```
Tue Jan 28 21:46:14.886 [DataFileSync] flushing mmaps took 10973ms  for 21 files
```

The `duration` of these lines should also be extracted (here 10973 milliseconds) and exposed via the `duration` name.


#### Queries, Updates, Deletes

Query operations, as well as updates and deletes, have a `query` part to match a subset of documents. Example:

```
2014-05-31T14:20:56.002-0400 [conn16] query test.coll query: { query: { foo: "value", bar: "another value" }, orderby: { number: -1.0 } } planSummary: EOF ntoreturn:0 ntoskip:0 keyUpdates:0 numYields:0 locks(micros) r:106 nreturned:0 reslen:20 12ms
```

The query here is `{ foo: "value", bar: "another value" }`. The query shape of this query is `{ foo: 1, bar: 1}`. The sort shape is `{ number: -1.0 }` (sorts are always represented as shape, with only 1 or -1 as valid values).

The regex pattern names to extract are `query` (full query with values), `query_shape`, `sort_shape`.


#### n-Counters

Some operations (mostly CRUD operations) return values for the following counters, which should be exposed as well:

*  `nscanned`
*  `ntoreturn`
*  `ntoskip`
*  `nupdated`
*  `nreturned`
*  `ninserted`
*  `ndeleted`
*  `nmoved`
*  `numYields`

#### Locks

Some operations require to take read/write locks. These lock times are measured in microseconds. They follow this pattern (an operation either prints read `r` or write `w` lock times, but not both).

```
locks(micros) r:106
```

In this case, the read lock was held for 106 microseconds. 

The regex pattern names are `r` and `w`.


### Events

MongoDB logs a large number of unstructured event lines, that follow the simple pattern 
```
{{timestamp}} [{{thread}}] {{description}}
```

Some of these events are generally more useful for issue diagnosis and should be extracted, for example

* Start and termination of the server 
* Index builds (start, progress, end)
* ...

Events have an event name (for example "ready", "index", ...) and optionally some data specific to the event. They are returned as a document of the form `{"name": "index", "data": { ... }`.
